To compute this we want to calculate the expected utility if the cardholder is
both travelling and not travelling for each decision (block and not block)

We get this data:

Block, Trav:   -9.901
Block, ~Trav:  -9.618
~Block, Trav:  -990.05
~Block, ~Trav: -961.60

Now we multiply by the probability of travelling (0.05) and we get this:
Block:  -9.6318
~Block: -962.998

So we would still block the transaction, so the expected utility would be
-9.6318, which is a gain of 0.21834 over when the value of Trav was unknown.

Below is the work done by my factor inference program:

Initial factors: f1(Trav), f3(Fraud, Trav), f2(OC), f4(CRP, OC), f5(FP, Trav, Fraud), f6(IP, OC, Fraud)
Evidence: FP=True, IP=False, CRP=True, Trav=True
New factor f7(Trav, Fraud) by restricting f5(FP, Trav, Fraud) with FP=True
New factor f8(OC, Fraud) by restricting f6(IP, OC, Fraud) with IP=False
New factor f9(OC) by restricting f4(CRP, OC) with CRP=True
New factor f10() by restricting f1(Trav) with Trav=True
New factor f11(Fraud) by restricting f3(Fraud, Trav) with Trav=True
New factor f12(Fraud) by restricting f7(Trav, Fraud) with Trav=True
New factor f15(Fraud) by summing out f2(OC), f9(OC), f8(OC, Fraud) over OC

Result:
Fraud  0.00989999
~Fraud 0.9901  


Initial factors: f1(Trav), f3(Fraud, Trav), f2(OC), f4(CRP, OC), f5(FP, Trav, Fraud), f6(IP, OC, Fraud)
Evidence: FP=True, IP=False, CRP=True, Trav=False
New factor f20(Trav, Fraud) by restricting f5(FP, Trav, Fraud) with FP=True
New factor f21(OC, Fraud) by restricting f6(IP, OC, Fraud) with IP=False
New factor f22(OC) by restricting f4(CRP, OC) with CRP=True
New factor f23() by restricting f1(Trav) with Trav=False
New factor f24(Fraud) by restricting f3(Fraud, Trav) with Trav=False
New factor f25(Fraud) by restricting f20(Trav, Fraud) with Trav=False
New factor f28(Fraud) by summing out f2(OC), f22(OC), f21(OC, Fraud) over OC

Result:
Fraud  0.038235
~Fraud 0.961765
