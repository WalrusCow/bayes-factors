The factors we can influence are: Foreign purchase and computer related purchase.

That is, we could make the internet purchase a foreign purchase, and we could
make a computer related purchase prior to the internet purchase.

The best idea is to make a computer-related purchase first.  Making it a
foreign purchase would obviously increase the chance of fraud. Making a
computer-related first decreases the chance of our later purchase being found
fraudulent from 0.00848 to 0.00733.
